description: PRIMARY TRIGGER — create a new `D-NNN` chore task for maintenance that deserves a trace but isn't a feature or bug: small refactor, dependency upgrade, build/lint tweak, config or doc fix. Options: `--context "<what + why>"`, `--origin "<source>"`, `--status backlog|planned|in-development` (default `in-development`). For new capabilities use `feature`; for broken behavior use `bug`.

# Chore

Create a chore task for maintenance that deserves a trace but is not a new feature nor a bug fix: small refactor, dependency upgrade, build/lint tweak, config or doc adjustment without behavior change.

## Title vs Context

When the human asks in loose phrasing, **synthesize** — do not pass the raw sentence to the CLI.

- `<title>`: short imperative, 5–8 words, ≤60 chars. Captures the *what*. Title is what shows in `NOME DO CHAT` and in task lists.
- `<context>`: full motivation, scenario, success criteria. Captures the *why*. Multi-line allowed. Goes into `task.context`, `FEATURES.md`, and search.

Example:

> Human: "queria que o /finish mostrasse o tempo total da task"
>
> → title:   `Show total task time on /finish`
> → context: `User wants /finish to print elapsed time since task creation so they can see how long the work took without opening JSON.`

If the human-provided phrasing already reads as an imperative under 60 chars, use it as-is. Synthesis is for loose/long phrasings, not a mandatory rewrite.

**Run the engine.** It ships inside the plugin — no repo clone, no manual `init`. Invoke it through `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` (the plugin install dir), never a path relative to the working directory:

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/guia.py" <command>      # bash (canonical — you call via the Bash tool)
python "$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/bin/guia.py" <command>    # PowerShell
```

The engine roots itself at the current project and auto-creates `.guia/` there on the first command. Substitute `<command>` with the verb and arguments for this skill:

```text
chore "<title>" --context "<what + why>"
```

Useful flags:
- `--context "<what/why>"` — describes the maintenance and its motivation.
- `--status backlog|planned|in-development` (default `in-development`).
- `--origin "<source>"`.

When to use `chore` vs alternatives:
- **New feature** (user-visible capability) → use `/feature`.
- **Bug** (broken/regression) → use `/bug`.
- **Chore** → everything else: cleanup, dep upgrade, folder organization, config tweak, improving an error message without changing behavior.

## After running the script

1. Read `.guia/current-task.json` to confirm the new state.
2. Repeat the exact `NOME DO CHAT: ...` line printed by the script — do not paraphrase or translate it.
3. **Always call `mark_chapter`** (`mcp__ccd_session__mark_chapter`) with that title — this is the reliable rename surrogate in Claude Code: it places a visible divider in the transcript and a ToC entry the developer can jump to. Works on every Claude Code build that has the `ccd_session` MCP loaded.
4. **Also try `/rename <suggested-title>`** if this Claude Code build exposes the slash command. No harm if it doesn't — `mark_chapter` already covers the navigation need; this is bonus sidebar rename when supported.
5. If neither path works, print the title prominently as a final fallback.

## File locks

Before editing files, honor `features/registry.yaml`. If a target file is locked:

1. **Stop** before the edit.
2. **Explain to the developer**, in this order:
   - The lock id and which functionality it protects.
   - Why the planned edit is needed.
   - Expected impact (what changes, who notices).
   - Regression risk (what could break that is currently working).
   - Alternatives (route the change through a different file, scope reduction, etc.).
3. **Ask** for explicit authorization to proceed (or to unlock).
4. Only after the developer authorizes, edit — or use `python core/lock/check-lock.py unlock <id>` if the developer asks for the lock to be removed.

Never bypass a lock silently. The hook at commit time will reject the commit anyway, and the developer loses trust if the agent treats locks as advisory.

Then continue with the maintenance work.
