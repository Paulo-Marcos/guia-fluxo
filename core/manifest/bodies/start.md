# Start

**Start work on a Planejada task (or directly from the Backlog).** Moves status to `Em desenvolvimento`. Assumes triage (kind = feature/bug/chore) is done — if you still need to decide the kind, use `$promote`.

Run:

```powershell
.\core\bin\guia.ps1 start <D-NNN> [--note "Starting now because..."]
```

Distinct from:
- `$promote <B-NNN>`: triage a backlog item deciding kind and plan before starting.
- `$plan`: mark as triaged without starting.
- `$feature/$bug/$chore` (new tasks): create a fresh task already `Em desenvolvimento`.

Accepts transition from `Backlog` (shortcut that skips `Planejada`) or `Planejada`. Fails if the task is already `Em desenvolvimento`, in a terminal state (`Validada`, `Finalizada`, `Cancelada`), or `Bloqueada` (use `$unblock`).

Tasks promoted from `Backlog` enter `FEATURES.md`.

Portable fallback (Linux/Mac/no PowerShell): `python core/src/guia.py start <D-NNN>`.
