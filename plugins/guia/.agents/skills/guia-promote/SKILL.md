description: EVALUATE-AND-CONVERT one parked item. Takes `<B-NNN>` or `<D-NNN>` with `status=Backlog`. The agent reads the item, asks any missing question, proposes a plan, calls out locks/risks, and asks worktree y/n — only after developer OK runs the CLI. Required: `--kind feature|bug|chore`. Options: `--assessment "<verdict>"`, `--plan "<step>"` (repeatable), `--worktree`, `--branch <name>`, `--worktree-path <path>`. To add/list parked items use `backlog`; to create a task without parking first use `feature`/`bug`/`chore`.

# Promote

Evaluate one backlog item and convert it into an in-development task. The agent does the evaluation; the developer authorizes.

Process:

1. Read the requested item (`<B-NNN>` or `<D-NNN>` with status=Backlog) from `.guia/backlog.json` / `.guia/tasks.json`.
2. Decide kind: `feature`, `bug`, or `chore`.
3. Check if title/context are actionable. If information is missing, ask the developer before creating a task.
4. Propose a short execution plan, impacted areas, lock risks, and tradeoffs.
5. Ask whether to use a worktree.
6. After the developer approves, run the command below.

**Run the engine** via the repo wrapper (portable fallback on Linux/Mac/no PowerShell: `python core/src/guia.py <command>`):

```powershell
.\core\bin\guia.ps1 <command>
```

Substitute `<command>` with the verb and arguments for this skill:

```text
promote B-001 --kind feature --assessment "..." --plan "..."
```

If the developer chose a worktree, include `--worktree` — branch becomes `codex/<slug>` and path `.claude/worktrees/<slug>` (override with `--branch` or `--worktree-path`). `finish` removes the worktree at closing.

## After running the script

1. Read `.guia/current-task.json` to confirm the new state.
2. Repeat the exact `NOME DA DEMANDA: ...` line printed by the script — do not paraphrase or translate it. It names the **current demand**, not the chat: one chat may hold several demandas (e.g. an epic D-049 and its stories), so the line is pure demand info, not a chat title.
3. **Optional — rename the chat only if it helps.** The print does not rename anything; renaming is a convenience, never required. **Codex App:** when the thread tools are loaded and this chat tracks a single demand, call `codex_app.list_threads` to find the current thread id, then `codex_app.set_thread_title` with the demand title. Skip the rename when the chat holds multiple demandas. If the tools are not loaded, search for thread tools first.
4. **Antigravity (no thread API):** nothing to rename programmatically — the printed line is enough.
5. If shell access fails, surface the exact command the developer can run by hand instead of silently failing.

## File locks

Before editing files, honor `.guia/locks/registry.yaml`. If a target file is locked:

1. **Stop** before the edit.
2. **Explain to the developer**, in this order:
   - The lock id and which functionality it protects.
   - Why the planned edit is needed.
   - Expected impact (what changes, who notices).
   - Regression risk (what could break that is currently working).
   - Alternatives (route the change through a different file, scope reduction, etc.).
3. **Ask** for explicit authorization to proceed (or to unlock).
4. Only after the developer authorizes, edit — or use `python core/lock/check-lock.py unlock <id>` if the developer asks for the lock to be removed.

Never bypass a lock silently. The hook at commit time will reject the commit anyway, and the developer loses trust if the agent treats locks as advisory.

Then execute the approved plan.
