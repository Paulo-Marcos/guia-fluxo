description: CLOSE an already-validated task — runs the docs-check hook and commits by default. Use only after the developer confirms validation in real use. Required when `.guia/docs-map.yaml` exists: `--docs-touched <path>` (repeatable) or `--docs-skip "<reason>"`. Options: `--file`, `--summary`, `--validation` (same as ready), `--no-commit` (dry close), `--lock --lock-id <slug> --lock-description "..."` (protect files after close). For handoff to validation use `ready`; for inspection use `status`.

# Finish

Close an already-validated task. Run **only after** the developer confirms validation in real use — `finish` is the closing gate, not a shortcut.

**Run the engine** via the repo wrapper (portable fallback on Linux/Mac/no PowerShell: `python core/src/guia.py <command>`):

```powershell
.\core\bin\guia.ps1 <command>
```

Substitute `<command>` with the verb and arguments for this skill:

## 1) Docs hook (mandatory when `.guia/docs-map.yaml` exists)

Run the docs check before closing:

```text
docs-check
```

For each listed candidate:
- Open the file and decide if this task changes anything relevant to it.
- Update what makes sense (README pointer, CLI reference entry, CHANGELOG entry, ADR, explanation paragraph).
- Note the paths you touched.

If the project has no `.guia/docs-map.yaml`, the hook is a no-op and `finish` runs as before.

## 2) Close

```text
finish <D-NNN> --docs-touched docs/reference/cli.md --docs-touched CHANGELOG.md
# or, when nothing needed touching:
finish <D-NNN> --docs-skip "internal flow, no user-facing change"
```

`finish` commits by default. Use `--no-commit` for dry close. Lock with `--lock --lock-id feature-slug --lock-description "..."` only when the developer asks for it.

## After running the script

1. Read `.guia/current-task.json` to confirm the new state.
2. Repeat the exact `NOME DO CHAT: ...` line printed by the script — do not paraphrase or translate it.
3. **Codex App:** if the thread tools are loaded, call `codex_app.list_threads` to find the current thread id, then call `codex_app.set_thread_title` with the title printed after `NOME DO CHAT:`. If the tools are not loaded, search for thread tools first.
4. **Antigravity (no thread API):** print the title prominently as best-effort — the host has no programmatic rename today.
5. If shell access fails, surface the exact command the developer can run by hand instead of silently failing.

## File locks

Before editing files, honor `features/registry.yaml`. If a target file is locked:

1. **Stop** before the edit.
2. **Explain to the developer**, in this order:
   - The lock id and which functionality it protects.
   - Why the planned edit is needed.
   - Expected impact (what changes, who notices).
   - Regression risk (what could break that is currently working).
   - Alternatives (route the change through a different file, scope reduction, etc.).
3. **Ask** for explicit authorization to proceed (or to unlock).
4. Only after the developer authorizes, edit — or use `python core/lock/check-lock.py unlock <id>` if the developer asks for the lock to be removed.

Never bypass a lock silently. The hook at commit time will reject the commit anyway, and the developer loses trust if the agent treats locks as advisory.

Task is closed.
