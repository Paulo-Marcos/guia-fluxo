# Unblock

**Resume a paused task.** Moves status from `Bloqueada` back to `Em desenvolvimento`. Use after `block` once the dependency/decision blocking the work has been resolved.

**Run the engine** via the repo wrapper (portable fallback on Linux/Mac/no PowerShell: `python core/src/guia.py <command>`):

```powershell
.\core\bin\guia.ps1 <command>
```

Substitute `<command>` with the verb and arguments for this skill:

```text
unblock <D-NNN> [--note "What unblocked it"]
```

`--note` is optional — useful when it is worth recording what unblocked it (decision made, dependency resolved).

Fails if the task was not in `Bloqueada` (preserves the flow states).

## After running the script

1. Read `.guia/current-task.json` to confirm the new state.
2. Repeat the exact `NOME DA DEMANDA: ...` line printed by the script — do not paraphrase or translate it. It names the **current demand**, not the chat: one chat may hold several demandas (e.g. an epic D-049 and its stories), so the line is pure demand info, not a chat title.
3. **Optional — rename the chat only if it helps.** The print does not rename anything; renaming is a convenience, never required. **Codex App:** when the thread tools are loaded and this chat tracks a single demand, call `codex_app.list_threads` to find the current thread id, then `codex_app.set_thread_title` with the demand title. Skip the rename when the chat holds multiple demandas. If the tools are not loaded, search for thread tools first.
4. **Antigravity (no thread API):** nothing to rename programmatically — the printed line is enough.
5. If shell access fails, surface the exact command the developer can run by hand instead of silently failing.
