description: HANDOFF to developer validation — does NOT close the task. **The agent runs this itself when implementation ends**, never the human. The gate that forces human-in-the-loop before `finish`. Options: `--file <path>` (changed files, repeatable), `--summary "<note>"` (implementation notes, repeatable), `--validation "<cmd>"` (validations that passed, repeatable), `--pending "<gap>"` (manual checks still needed, repeatable). To close after validation use `finish`; to inspect without changing state use `status`.

# Ready

**The agent (you) calls this when implementation ends** — not the human. `ready` is the handoff to human validation; the human then validates in real use, and you call `finish` afterward. Do not skip `ready` and go straight to `finish` — that bypasses the human-in-the-loop gate.

**Run the engine** via the repo wrapper (portable fallback on Linux/Mac/no PowerShell: `python core/src/guia.py <command>`):

```powershell
.\core\bin\guia.ps1 <command>
```

Substitute `<command>` with the verb and arguments for this skill:

```text
ready <D-NNN> --file path/to/file --summary "What changed" --validation "What passed"
```

Pass changed files with `--file`, implementation notes with `--summary`, validation commands run with `--validation`, and manual gaps still pending with `--pending`.

## After running the script

1. Read `.guia/current-task.json` to confirm the new state.
2. Repeat the exact `NOME DO CHAT: ...` line printed by the script — do not paraphrase or translate it.
3. **Codex App:** if the thread tools are loaded, call `codex_app.list_threads` to find the current thread id, then call `codex_app.set_thread_title` with the title printed after `NOME DO CHAT:`. If the tools are not loaded, search for thread tools first.
4. **Antigravity (no thread API):** print the title prominently as best-effort — the host has no programmatic rename today.
5. If shell access fails, surface the exact command the developer can run by hand instead of silently failing.

Then **stop and wait** for the developer to validate. Do not run `finish` until the developer confirms validation in real use.
