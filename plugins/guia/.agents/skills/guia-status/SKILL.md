description: "READ-ONLY — show the current active task and its demand title. Optional: `<D-NNN>` to inspect a specific task instead of the current one. Never creates, modifies, advances, or closes a task. To create use `feature`/`bug`/`chore`; for state transitions use `ready`/`finish`/`block`/`unblock`/`cancel`."

# Status

Show the current Guia Fluxo task and the suggested chat title. Read-only — never mutates state.

**Run the engine** via the repo wrapper (portable fallback on Linux/Mac/no PowerShell: `python core/src/guia.py <command>`):

```powershell
.\core\bin\guia.ps1 <command>
```

Substitute `<command>` with the verb and arguments for this skill:

```text
status            # current task
status <D-NNN>    # a specific task
```

## After running the script

1. Read `.guia/current-task.json` to confirm the new state.
2. Repeat the exact `NOME DA DEMANDA: ...` line printed by the script — do not paraphrase or translate it. It names the **current demand**, not the chat: one chat may hold several demandas (e.g. an epic D-049 and its stories), so the line is pure demand info, not a chat title.
3. **Name the chat and record it (D-157).** Run `chat <D-NNN>` for the stable name (`NOME DO CHAT: ...`). **Codex App:** when the thread tools are loaded and this chat is dedicated to the demand, call `codex_app.list_threads` to find the current thread id, then `codex_app.set_thread_title` with that name (search for the thread tools first if they are not loaded). When the chat already holds other demandas, do not rename it; use the name it already has. Either way record it with `chat <D-NNN> --title "<name>"` and show the name to the developer - the queue and `status --all` cite it so they can come back.
4. **Antigravity (no thread API):** nothing to rename programmatically — the printed line is enough.
5. If shell access fails, surface the exact command the developer can run by hand instead of silently failing.
