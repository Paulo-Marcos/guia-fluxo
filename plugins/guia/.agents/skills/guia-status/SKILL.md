description: READ-ONLY — show the current active task and the suggested chat title. Optional: `<D-NNN>` to inspect a specific task instead of the current one. Never creates, modifies, advances, or closes a task. To create use `feature`/`bug`/`chore`; for state transitions use `ready`/`finish`/`block`/`unblock`/`cancel`.

# Status

Show the current Guia Fluxo task and the suggested chat title. Read-only — never mutates state.

**Run the engine** via the repo wrapper (portable fallback on Linux/Mac/no PowerShell: `python core/src/guia.py <command>`):

```powershell
.\core\bin\guia.ps1 <command>
```

Substitute `<command>` with the verb and arguments for this skill:

```text
status            # current task
status <D-NNN>    # a specific task
```

## After running the script

1. Read `.guia/current-task.json` to confirm the new state.
2. Repeat the exact `NOME DO CHAT: ...` line printed by the script — do not paraphrase or translate it.
3. **Codex App:** if the thread tools are loaded, call `codex_app.list_threads` to find the current thread id, then call `codex_app.set_thread_title` with the title printed after `NOME DO CHAT:`. If the tools are not loaded, search for thread tools first.
4. **Antigravity (no thread API):** print the title prominently as best-effort — the host has no programmatic rename today.
5. If shell access fails, surface the exact command the developer can run by hand instead of silently failing.
