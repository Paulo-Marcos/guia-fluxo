description: PLAN — mark a task as `Planejada` (triaged but not started yet). Accepts transition from `Backlog` (parked item that gained priority) or from `Em desenvolvimento` (deprioritized but already known). Options: `--note "<rationale>"`. To begin work use `start` (already triaged) or `promote` (still needs triage); to park without deciding use `backlog`.

# Plan

**Mark the task as `Planejada`** (triaged but not yet started). Use when you already know you will work on the task but not now — moves out of `Backlog` (parked) or back from `Em desenvolvimento` (deprioritized).

**Run the engine** via the repo wrapper (portable fallback on Linux/Mac/no PowerShell: `python core/src/guia.py <command>`):

```powershell
.\core\bin\guia.ps1 <command>
```

Substitute `<command>` with the verb and arguments for this skill:

```text
plan <D-NNN> [--note "Why planning now"]
```

Distinct from:
- `$backlog add`: park an idea that has not been triaged yet.
- `$promote`: triage a backlog item, deciding kind and plan, then start immediately.
- `$start`: start now (moves from `Backlog` or `Planejada` to `Em desenvolvimento`).

Fails if the task is in a terminal state (`Validada`, `Finalizada`, `Cancelada`) or already `Planejada`. Tasks promoted from `Backlog` to `Planejada` enter `.guia/DEMANDAS.md` (join the catalog).

## After running the script

1. Read `.guia/current-task.json` to confirm the new state.
2. Repeat the exact `NOME DA DEMANDA: ...` line printed by the script — do not paraphrase or translate it. It names the **current demand**, not the chat: one chat may hold several demandas (e.g. an epic D-049 and its stories), so the line is pure demand info, not a chat title.
3. **Optional — rename the chat only if it helps.** The print does not rename anything; renaming is a convenience, never required. **Codex App:** when the thread tools are loaded and this chat tracks a single demand, call `codex_app.list_threads` to find the current thread id, then `codex_app.set_thread_title` with the demand title. Skip the rename when the chat holds multiple demandas. If the tools are not loaded, search for thread tools first.
4. **Antigravity (no thread API):** nothing to rename programmatically — the printed line is enough.
5. If shell access fails, surface the exact command the developer can run by hand instead of silently failing.
