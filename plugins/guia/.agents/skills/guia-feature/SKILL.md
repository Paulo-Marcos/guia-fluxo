description: PRIMARY TRIGGER — create a new `D-NNN` feature task for a new capability or new functionality, starting implementation immediately. Options: `--context "<why>"` (motivation), `--origin "<source>"` (default: Guia Fluxo), `--status backlog|planned|in-development` (default `in-development`). For defects use `bug`; for maintenance use `chore`; to park without starting use `backlog`.

# Feature

Create a new feature task before editing code. Use when the human asks for a NEW capability (not a bug fix, not maintenance).

## Title vs Context

When the human asks in loose phrasing, **synthesize** — do not pass the raw sentence to the CLI.

- `<title>`: short imperative, 5–8 words, ≤60 chars. Captures the *what*. Title is what shows in `NOME DO CHAT` and in task lists.
- `<context>`: full motivation, scenario, success criteria. Captures the *why*. Multi-line allowed. Goes into `task.context`, `FEATURES.md`, and search.

Example:

> Human: "queria que o /finish mostrasse o tempo total da task"
>
> → title:   `Show total task time on /finish`
> → context: `User wants /finish to print elapsed time since task creation so they can see how long the work took without opening JSON.`

If the human-provided phrasing already reads as an imperative under 60 chars, use it as-is. Synthesis is for loose/long phrasings, not a mandatory rewrite.

**Run the engine** via the repo wrapper (portable fallback on Linux/Mac/no PowerShell: `python core/src/guia.py <command>`):

```powershell
.\core\bin\guia.ps1 <command>
```

Substitute `<command>` with the verb and arguments for this skill:

```text
feature "<title>" --context "<context>"
```

Useful flags:
- `--context "<why>"` — motivation (synthesize per the rules above).
- `--origin "<source>"` — alternate origin (default: "Guia Fluxo (date)").
- `--status backlog|planned|in-development` — default `in-development`.

## After running the script

1. Read `.guia/current-task.json` to confirm the new state.
2. Repeat the exact `NOME DO CHAT: ...` line printed by the script — do not paraphrase or translate it.
3. **Codex App:** if the thread tools are loaded, call `codex_app.list_threads` to find the current thread id, then call `codex_app.set_thread_title` with the title printed after `NOME DO CHAT:`. If the tools are not loaded, search for thread tools first.
4. **Antigravity (no thread API):** print the title prominently as best-effort — the host has no programmatic rename today.
5. If shell access fails, surface the exact command the developer can run by hand instead of silently failing.

## File locks

Before editing files, honor `features/registry.yaml`. If a target file is locked:

1. **Stop** before the edit.
2. **Explain to the developer**, in this order:
   - The lock id and which functionality it protects.
   - Why the planned edit is needed.
   - Expected impact (what changes, who notices).
   - Regression risk (what could break that is currently working).
   - Alternatives (route the change through a different file, scope reduction, etc.).
3. **Ask** for explicit authorization to proceed (or to unlock).
4. Only after the developer authorizes, edit — or use `python core/lock/check-lock.py unlock <id>` if the developer asks for the lock to be removed.

Never bypass a lock silently. The hook at commit time will reject the commit anyway, and the developer loses trust if the agent treats locks as advisory.

Then continue with the implementation.
