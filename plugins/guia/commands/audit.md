description: "AUDIT — show what to audit on the PR head (the `skills.audit` skill, default `pr-audit`, or the built-in checklist when it is missing), then record the result: `--report <file>` comments it on the PR; `--approve` adds the `<!-- auditoria-aprovada sha=<head> -->` marker and saves `auditedSha` + `auditedPatchId`; `--finding SEV=N` (repeatable) records open findings for the `pilot` auto-finish. Also `--skill-ran`, `--skill-missing`. Agent at level >= `pr`. Before: `ship`; after: `queue add`."

# Audit

Audit the PR head adversarially: read everything before executing anything from the PR.

**Run the engine.** It ships inside the plugin — no repo clone, no manual `init`. Invoke it through `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` (the plugin install dir), never a path relative to the working directory:

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/guia.py" <command>      # bash (canonical — you call via the Bash tool)
python "$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/bin/guia.py" <command>    # PowerShell
```

The engine roots itself at the current project and auto-creates `.guia/` there on the first command. Substitute `<command>` with the verb and arguments for this skill:

```text
audit [D-NNN]                                     # what to audit (skill or checklist)
audit [D-NNN] --report report.md --approve --finding BLOQUEANTE=0 --finding CORRIGIR=0 --skill-ran pr-audit
```

- The marker must point at the head GitHub sees: push (or `ship`) first.
- Without `--finding`, the `pilot` level never closes the demand on its own.

## After running the script

1. Read `.guia/current-task.json` to confirm the new state.
2. Repeat the exact `NOME DA DEMANDA: ...` line printed by the script — do not paraphrase or translate it. It identifies the **current demand**, not the chat: a single chat may hold several demandas (e.g. an epic D-049 and its stories), so the line is pure demand info, not a chat title.
3. **Name the chat and record it (D-157)** — when this chat starts or resumes work on the demand, so the developer can come back to it when the queue returns it or leaves it pending:
   - Run `chat <D-NNN>`: it prints `NOME DO CHAT: ...`, a stable name without the status tag.
   - **Chat dedicated to this demand:** rename the session to that name — the session-title tool when this build has one, `mark_chapter` (`mcp__ccd_session__mark_chapter`, also places a divider + ToC entry), and/or `/rename <name>` — then record it: `chat <D-NNN> --title "<name>"`.
   - **Chat that already holds other demandas:** do not rename it to this demand (it would mislead); record the name the chat already has (the demand it started with): `chat <D-NNN> --title "<that name>"`.
   - **Always show the chat name to the developer**, even when renaming is not available, so it can be saved. The queue, `next` and `status --all` cite it ("volte ao chat: ...").
4. **Record the model actually used (D-154)** — once per chat: `model <D-NNN> --who chat --model <haiku|sonnet|opus|fable> --purpose "<what this chat did>"`. When you delegate to a subagent, pick its model by what it does (locate/read code: haiku; a 1-2 file change: sonnet; review or audit: opus - never below) and record it the same way with `--who subagent`. Show the `MODELO USADO ...` line: the developer compares it with the recommendation (`model --summary`).
