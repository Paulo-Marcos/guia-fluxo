description: TERMINAL CANCEL — closes the task with `status=Cancelada` (terminal, does not return). Use when the task will NOT be completed: created by mistake, scope dropped, wrong promote. Required: `--reason "<motive>"`. Options: `--keep-worktree` (default removes the worktree if present), `--set-current` (default clears current-task.json if the cancelled task was current). For a temporary pause that will resume use `block`; for a validated close use `finish`.

# Cancel

**Trigger by you (the agent) or the user, when the task will NOT be completed.** Marks the task as `Cancelada` (terminal) with a mandatory reason. Distinct from `block` (pause, will resume) and `finish` (validated and closed).

Typical cases:
- Demanda criada por engano.
- `promote` errado de um item de backlog.
- Mudanca de escopo: o que parecia uma feature/bug nao se justifica mais.

**Run the engine.** It ships inside the plugin — no repo clone, no manual `init`. Invoke it through `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` (the plugin install dir), never a path relative to the working directory:

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/guia.py" <command>      # bash (canonical — you call via the Bash tool)
python "$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/bin/guia.py" <command>    # PowerShell
```

The engine roots itself at the current project and auto-creates `.guia/` there on the first command. Substitute `<command>` with the verb and arguments for this skill:

```text
cancel <D-NNN> --reason "Motivo curto"
```

`--reason` is **required** (justification stays in history under `task.cancellations[]` and in `FEATURES.md`).

Useful flags:
- `--keep-worktree`: do not remove the associated worktree (default: remove if present).
- `--set-current`: keep the task as current after canceling (default: clear `.guia/current-task.json` if the canceled task was current).

Fails if the task is already in a terminal state (`Validada`, `Finalizada`, `Cancelada`).

## After running the script

1. Read `.guia/current-task.json` to confirm the new state.
2. Repeat the exact `NOME DO CHAT: ...` line printed by the script — do not paraphrase or translate it.
3. **Always call `mark_chapter`** (`mcp__ccd_session__mark_chapter`) with that title — this is the reliable rename surrogate in Claude Code: it places a visible divider in the transcript and a ToC entry the developer can jump to. Works on every Claude Code build that has the `ccd_session` MCP loaded.
4. **Also try `/rename <suggested-title>`** if this Claude Code build exposes the slash command. No harm if it doesn't — `mark_chapter` already covers the navigation need; this is bonus sidebar rename when supported.
5. If neither path works, print the title prominently as a final fallback.
