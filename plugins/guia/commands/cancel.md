description: "TERMINAL CANCEL — closes the task with `status=Cancelada` (terminal, does not return). Use when the task will NOT be completed: created by mistake, scope dropped, wrong promote. Required: `--reason \"<motive>\"`. Options: `--keep-worktree` (default removes the worktree if present), `--set-current` (default clears current-task.json if the cancelled task was current). For a temporary pause that will resume use `block`; for a validated close use `finish`."

# Cancel

**Trigger by you (the agent) or the user, when the task will NOT be completed.** Marks the task as `Cancelada` (terminal) with a mandatory reason. Distinct from `block` (pause, will resume) and `finish` (validated and closed).

Typical cases:
- Demanda criada por engano.
- `promote` errado de um item de backlog.
- Mudanca de escopo: o que parecia uma feature/bug nao se justifica mais.

**Run the engine.** It ships inside the plugin — no repo clone, no manual `init`. Invoke it through `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` (the plugin install dir), never a path relative to the working directory:

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/guia.py" <command>      # bash (canonical — you call via the Bash tool)
python "$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/bin/guia.py" <command>    # PowerShell
```

The engine roots itself at the current project and auto-creates `.guia/` there on the first command. Substitute `<command>` with the verb and arguments for this skill:

```text
cancel <D-NNN> --reason "Motivo curto"
```

`--reason` is **required** (justification stays in history under `task.cancellations[]` and in `.guia/DEMANDAS.md`).

Useful flags:
- `--keep-worktree`: do not remove the associated worktree (default: remove if present).
- `--set-current`: keep the task as current after canceling (default: clear `.guia/current-task.json` if the canceled task was current).

Fails if the task is already in a terminal state (`Validada`, `Finalizada`, `Cancelada`).

## After running the script

1. Read `.guia/current-task.json` to confirm the new state.
2. Repeat the exact `NOME DA DEMANDA: ...` line printed by the script — do not paraphrase or translate it. It identifies the **current demand**; in this demand's own chat it is also the chat title (step 4).
3. **One demand, one chat, on the recommended model (D-185).** A chat belongs to one demand. Run the triage of step 5 **first**, then decide where the demand runs:
   - **Work it here** only when this chat holds no other demand **and** runs on the recommended model.
   - **Otherwise open its own chat** - a demand that comes up while working another (an epic story, a follow-up, a bug found on the way), or a recommended model different from this chat's. Create it with the CLI (`--status planned`, or `--under E-NNN` for a story), then call `start_session` (`mcp__ccd_session__start_session`; load it with ToolSearch `select:mcp__ccd_session__start_session` when deferred) with: `title` = its `NOME DA DEMANDA` line in the Guia format `D-NNN <emoji> - #<STAGE> - <title>` (e.g. `D-186 🐛 - #PLANEJADA - ...`; the new chat renames itself to `#DEV` when it runs `start`); `model` = the model id of the recommended family and `effort` = the recommended effort (`triage <D-NNN> --json` gives both); `context: "fresh"`; a brief that starts with `start <D-NNN>`. `initiation`: `"offer"` when the developer named the demand in their message, `"user_asked"` when they told you to start it, `"own_initiative"` when you found it. The app links the new session to this one.
   - `start_session` only lowers the model. When the recommendation is above this chat's (e.g. Opus from a Sonnet chat, or a Fable suggestion), say so and let the developer switch - never assume it.
   - An epic's chat holds the epic alone: each story runs in its own linked chat.
4. **Name the chat after the demand, and keep it current (D-185)** - every time the script prints `NOME DA DEMANDA` in this demand's chat (create, start, ready, ship, queue add, block...):
   - Rename the session to that exact line - the Guia format `D-NNN <emoji> - #<STAGE>[·<level>] - <title>`, never a free-form name - with `mcp__ccd_session_mgmt__set_session_title` (`session_id: "self"`). When the tool is deferred, load it first with ToolSearch `select:mcp__ccd_session_mgmt__set_session_title`. The title then follows the stage (`#DEV` -> `#VALIDACAO` -> `#PR`...), so the sidebar shows where each demand is.
   - Without that tool (CLI, another host, an unattended session that declines it): fall back to `mark_chapter` (`mcp__ccd_session__mark_chapter`, divider + ToC entry) and tell the developer the name to `/rename`.
   - **Record it once (D-157):** run `chat <D-NNN>` for the stable name (`NOME DO CHAT: ...`, ID + title, no stage) and save it with `chat <D-NNN> --title "<name>" --session <sessionId>` - the `sessionId` of this chat comes from `mcp__ccd_session_mgmt__get_session` (`session_id: "self"`; load it with ToolSearch `select:mcp__ccd_session_mgmt__get_session` when deferred); without that tool, omit `--session`. With the session recorded, the queue manager renames this chat to its final stage (`#INTEGRADA`, `#FINALIZADO`) when the queue integrates the demand (D-188). The queue, `next` and `status --all` cite it ("volte ao chat: ..."); the live title starts with the same `D-NNN`, so searching the sidebar for the ID finds it. **Always show the chat name to the developer**, even when renaming is not available.
5. **Recommend the model for this demand (D-153)** — when the demand is created or started in this chat, before step 3 decides where it runs: from what you read in the request and the code, run `triage <D-NNN> --scope <areas> [--risk auth|migration|concurrency|security|prod|data] [--uncertain] [--irreversible]` and show the `MODELO RECOMENDADO ...` line. If this chat runs on a different model, step 3 opens the demand's chat on the recommended one (lower) or tells the developer (higher). A Fable suggestion is only a suggestion: ask before using it. The audit never runs below Opus.
6. **Record the model actually used (D-154)** — once per chat: `model <D-NNN> --who chat --model <haiku|sonnet|opus|fable> --purpose "<what this chat did>"`. When you delegate to a subagent, pick its model by what it does (locate/read code: haiku; a 1-2 file change: sonnet; review or audit: opus - never below) and record it the same way with `--who subagent`. Show the `MODELO USADO ...` line: the developer compares it with the recommendation (`model --summary`).
