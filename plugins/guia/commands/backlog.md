description: DEFER-AND-PARK skill — never starts implementation. Subcommands: `add <title> --context "<why>"` parks an idea (saved to `.guia/tasks.json` with `status=Backlog`); `list` shows all parked items; `promote <id>` delegates to the promote flow. To start work immediately use `feature`/`bug`/`chore`; to evaluate one parked item before converting use `promote`.

# Backlog

Manage parked work without starting implementation. `backlog add` creates a `D-NNN` task with `status=Backlog`. `backlog list` shows all parked items. `backlog promote` delegates to the `/promote` flow.

## Title vs Context

When the human asks in loose phrasing, **synthesize** — do not pass the raw sentence to the CLI.

- `<title>`: short imperative, 5–8 words, ≤60 chars. Captures the *what*. Title is what shows in `NOME DA DEMANDA` and in task lists.
- `<context>`: full motivation, scenario, success criteria. Captures the *why*. Multi-line allowed. Goes into `task.context`, `.guia/DEMANDAS.md`, and search.

Example:

> Human: "queria que o /finish mostrasse o tempo total da task"
>
> → title:   `Show total task time on /finish`
> → context: `User wants /finish to print elapsed time since task creation so they can see how long the work took without opening JSON.`

If the human-provided phrasing already reads as an imperative under 60 chars, use it as-is. Synthesis is for loose/long phrasings, not a mandatory rewrite.

**Run the engine.** It ships inside the plugin — no repo clone, no manual `init`. Invoke it through `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` (the plugin install dir), never a path relative to the working directory:

```bash
python "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/bin/guia.py" <command>      # bash (canonical — you call via the Bash tool)
python "$env:CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT/bin/guia.py" <command>    # PowerShell
```

The engine roots itself at the current project and auto-creates `.guia/` there on the first command. Substitute `<command>` with the verb and arguments for this skill:

```text
backlog add "<title>" --context "<context>"    # if the user provided a title
backlog list                                   # show parked work
backlog promote B-001                          # promote a backlog item
```

## After running the script

1. Read `.guia/current-task.json` to confirm the new state.
2. Repeat the exact `NOME DA DEMANDA: ...` line printed by the script — do not paraphrase or translate it. It identifies the **current demand**, not the chat: a single chat may hold several demandas (e.g. an epic D-049 and its stories), so the line is pure demand info, not a chat title.
3. **Optional — rename the chat only if it actually helps navigation.** The print does *not* rename the chat; renaming is a user-facing convenience, never required. When this chat tracks a single demand and a rename would help the developer, call `mark_chapter` (`mcp__ccd_session__mark_chapter`) with the demand title (also places a divider + ToC entry) and/or try `/rename <title>` if this build exposes it. Skip the rename when the chat already holds multiple demandas — renaming to one demand's title would mislead.

**Do not start implementation.** Backlog parks work for later. To begin work on a parked item, use `/promote <B-NNN>` (evaluation + plan) or `/start <D-NNN>` (already triaged).
